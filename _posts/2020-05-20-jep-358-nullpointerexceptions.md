```java
class Car {
  private Tire tire;

  public Tire tire() {
    return this.tire;
  }

}
```

```java
class Tire {
  private String brand;

  public String brand() {
    return this.brand;
  }

}
```

```java
class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car ferrari = new Car();
    ferrari.tire().brand();
  }

}
```

Before JDK 14 the Null Pointer Exception it was like:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at dev.o1rb.study.jdk.Main.main(Main.java:7)
```

With JDK 14, the same exception looks like:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "dev.o1rb.study.jdk.Tire.brand()" because the return value of "dev.o1rb.study.jdk.Car.tire()" is null
	at dev.o1rb.study.jdk.Main.main(Main.java:7)
```

It's because of the JEP 358: Helpful NullPointerExceptions(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/358).
This JEP 358 improve the usability of NullPointerExceptions generated by the JVM by describing precisely which variable was null.

Only need add this command line when run `-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages` and enjoy.

It's very nice!
